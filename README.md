###### Vincent Van Gogh Exhibition in Dublin, Unknown [^1]

## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem Definition:
Mai is a wealthy art enthusiast who constantly purchases expensive and rare art pieces for her personal gallery. However, considering the number of artworks she has bought, she no longer knows how many she owns nor their respective origins! She is in immediate need of a digital gallery that will allow her to concisely keep track of all of the art works she owns. In addition, Mai requires the app to be secured through a login system, for the data to be stored in a dataset, and for the user interface to be clear and concise. 
 
### Success Criteria:
1. The application must have a secure registration and login system.
2. The user will be able to input all attributes (title, artist, date, and description of the art piece) which will be stored in the database through the interface.
3. The user will have the capacity to search for art pieces by title, artist, and/or date. 
4. The application will allow the user to view all values stored in the database. 
5. The application will include a “forgot password” button option if the user forgets their password. 
6. The application must encrypt the user’s password in the local SQL database.
7. The application must contain a login screen, registration screen, home screen, screen to record art pieces, and screen to view the past inputted data; in total 5 unique screens.

### Design Statement
I will design and construct a digital gallery for a client who requires an administrative system for artworks: Mai. The gallery will manage all of the art pieces Mai has purchased and will purchase in the future. Imperative information about each art piece such as the title, artist, date it was created, and a description of it, will be saved, too. All of the data will be saved in a local database using SQLite. The application will be programmed using the software Pycharm, the language Python and KivyMD for GUI construction. The project will be completed in 4 weeks and will be evaluated according to the criteria set above.

## Criteria B: Solution

### System Diagram

##### Figure 1. The System Diagram For the Application
The system diagram is a visual model of the application, its components and their interactions. As shown on Fig. 1, the input is done through a keyboard and the output is manifested on the display (screen.) The application will run on Python and KivyMD, using the software program PyCharm via the file names project3.py and project3.kv, respectively. Additionally, the various inputs from the user will all be stored in an SQL database called project3.db.
